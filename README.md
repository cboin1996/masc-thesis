# Description

My thesis for my MASc+AI degree at UofG.

# Development/Editing Instructions
Run the below command and the task will re-build the pdf for the project if any of the files change.

It helps to keep a PDF reader open that support auto reloading of the pdf file, such as [skim](https://skim-app.sourceforge.io) if using macOS.

# Build
